**Google search crawler**

# This is a "friendly" bot for educational and non intrusive use ONLY

The purpose of this crawler is to allow users to scrape data from a google search by KEYWORD DENSITY

A user is asked to enter *keywords or a search phrase*. The crawler then uses google search to find a user specified number of pages to go through and isolate sections where the requested keywords are dense.


## The program is in initial stages and by no means complete. Keep you posted.....

# RUNNING THE APP

I have *deliberately* left the virtual env in the repository to make things easier:
- Use virtualenv, downloadable through: pip install *sudo pip3 install virtualenv*
- run the app with the command ```python google_search.py```
